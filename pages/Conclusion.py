    - The Cambridge Analytica scandal involved the unauthorized collection of personal data from millions of Facebook users. The data was collected through a quiz app that harvested data not only from users who installed it but also from their friends. 
        The data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which used it to target political advertisements and influence voter behavior. The scandal highlighted significant privacy concerns and led to widespread criticism of both Facebook's data handling practices and the political use of data.
